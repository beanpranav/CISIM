This is the code for the agent-based model of the Transactive Systems Model of Collective Intelligence developed by Pranav Gupta during his doctoral program.
It implements the emergence of collective behavior from three underlying sociocogntive processes - Transactive Memory, Transactive Attention, and Transactive Reasoning Systems. 

It further extends this model to track three collaborative processes that can be used as a composite metric of the collective intelligence of the system. 
Virtual experiments are conducted to validate the emergent patterns as well as systemic dysfunctions.
